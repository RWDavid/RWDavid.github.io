        The field of artificial intelligence has rapidly grown in the past decade, finding its application
        in self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, and speech and facial recognition among others.
        An interesting concept which has recently been introduced to AI is music composition and interpretation.
        Companies have been attempting to develop machine learning software which will produce
        music ranging from the classical western art music to the pop songs frequently heard on the radio today.

        Developing such software could create a boost in today's society, as music has much cultural
        significance, especially in movies, video games, and various other forms of media.

        The complexity and difficulty of music composition makes this a challenging concept to program.
        Take romantic era music for example. Chopin's works are filled with subtle phrasings, thematic
        passages, and flowing movements, all of which are immensely important for avid music listeners.
        Being able to artistically control the velocity and flow of notes is a monumental feat.
